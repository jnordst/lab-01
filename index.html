        <h2>The Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Born without consent in 1994. I never asked to be here, but here I am.
        </p>

        <p>
            Attended Banting Memorial High School, and previously attended Georgian College as an Opticianry Student
        </p>

        <p>
            I previously obtained a GPA of 90% in Opticianry, a very challenging program! I self taught myself
            Javascript, Python and C# for fun while learning how to develop video games as a hobby, which led me to
            pursuing programming as a career.
        </p>

        <p>
            While I initially got into programming as a hobby game developer, I don't think I want to go into that
            field. I'm still not entirely sure which field of computer science I want to venture into but will likely go
            into web development or app development.
